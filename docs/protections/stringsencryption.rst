StringsEncryption
=================

How it works?
-------------
Protection encrypts strings using basic AES encryption, but not everyone like it because it makes the worse performance of application.

Had a big thoughts about `Unmanaged String <https://github.com/MrakDev/UnmanagedString>`_, but, as I tested in Mono it causes problems.
