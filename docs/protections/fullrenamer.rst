FullRenamer
===========

How it works?
-------------
Protection renames types/methods/fields, however, ignores things such as reflection, Unity Methods (Update/FixedUpdate/LateUpdate, i.e all of them), and the most popular frameworks for plugin development in Unity on GitHub - RocketMod, OpenMod, and rust-oxide-umod, you even could specify your methods/types to ignore.

Be careful, because renamer is tricky protection, not always useful, and does not always work properly. But, if you configure BitMono correctly Renamer can be a great protection (I'm about big projects, not crackmes).
