Unable to reference after protect?
==================================

You're probably stuck on a problem, when you want to use your ``.dll`` after protection, you protect it via BitMono and try to reference it in IDE or whatever else, you're doing a bit wrong, you need to have an original copy and use it as a reference, and as output folder (i.e Release\...) drop there a protected version of your ``.dll``.
