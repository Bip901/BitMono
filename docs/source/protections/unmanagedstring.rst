UnmanagedString
===============

How it works?
-------------
Protection creates native method with assembly code and protects strings only that can be encoded with `Windows-1252` encoding. 


.. warning::

    This protection is only compatible with .NET Framework and .NET Core, and doens't work with Mono.
